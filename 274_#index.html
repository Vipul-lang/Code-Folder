    <!-- //What is <html lang="en"> used for?
        
    The lang="en" attribute inside the <html> tag:
        1)Indicates the language of the page content (here, "en" for English).
        2)Helps search engines (SEO) understand the language of the page.
        3)Assists screen readers and accessibility tools to provide better pronunciation for visually impaired users. -->
    
    <!--# What happens if you don't include it?

        1)The browser will not break; the code will run normally.
        2)However, search engines and screen readers may not detect the correct language.
        3)Accessibility tools might mispronounce words if they assume the wrong language. -->
